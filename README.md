# Tableau Analytics Extensions API Specifications

OAS 2.0 and RAML 1.0 specifications for the Tableau Analytics Extensions API. These can be used in MuleSoft Anypoint Studio to quickly build and expose APIs that can be called from Tableau Desktop and Server.

Use the Tableau Analytics Extensions REST API to extend Tableau calculations dynamically to include popular data science programming languages and external tools and platforms. Analytics extensions can receive data from Tableau in real time and return it back after it has been scored, transformed, or augmented.
